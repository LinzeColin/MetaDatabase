### `ITER-20260621-002`

- Date: 2026-06-21
- Fact level: EXTRACTED for Phase 2 contracts, schemas, state machine, tests, and governance updates.
- Version before: 0.1.0
- Version after: 0.2.0
- Base commit: 4090ec69fea8fd5329eeee03a8ab842a5347b909
- Result commit: PENDING
- Task IDs: ADP-PHASE2-DATA-CONTRACTS-001
- Goal: Implement generic SourceItem, EvidenceClaim, Lesson, Storyboard, Publication, and RunRecord contracts without network or media side effects.
- Assumptions: Phase 2 remains offline-only and does not implement arXiv ingest, ranking, evidence extraction, lesson generation, media generation, runner automation, or SMTP transport.
- Files changed: contract/state code, schema files, tests, README, CHANGELOG, VERSION, and governance records.
- Model changes: Added MOD-ADP-004 active generic contract and RunRecord state gate.
- Parameter changes: Added PARAM-ADP-020 through PARAM-ADP-028.
- Commands run: `PYTHONPATH=arxiv-daily-push/src python3 -m unittest discover -s arxiv-daily-push/tests -q`; `python3 -m json.tool arxiv-daily-push/schemas/*.schema.json`.
- Test results: 13 unit tests OK; all schema JSON files parse OK.
- Successes: Generic source boundary accepts arXiv and a future GitHub source; P0 locator requirement and skipped state transitions fail closed.
- Failures: Initial `RunRecord.stages` empty-array validation failed and was fixed in `state_machine.py`.
- Decisions: Keep runtime validation dependency-free; use schemas as external contract and stdlib validators for local gates.
- Remaining risks: Phase 4 ranking and real arXiv adapter are not implemented.
- Rollback: Revert Phase 2 commit and restore version/governance records to 0.1.0.
- Next step: Start Phase 4 arXiv adapter/ranking only after final Phase 2 validation passes.

- Version after: 0.3.0
- Base commit: e5f15384887e8e4878a228673dfb487345d1a5c1
- Result commit: PENDING
- Task IDs: ADP-PHASE3-ARXIV-ADAPTER-001
- Goal: Implement the first concrete arXiv SourceAdapter without bulk ingest or media side effects.
- Assumptions: Phase 3 validates URL construction and Atom parsing locally; live scheduled ingestion remains future work.
- Files changed: arXiv adapter code, CLI commands, fixture, tests, source config, version files, and governance records.
- Model changes: Added MOD-ADP-005 active arXiv Atom source adapter.
- Parameter changes: Added PARAM-ADP-029 through PARAM-ADP-034.

- Test results: 19 unit tests OK.
- Successes: arXiv Atom fixture maps into generic SourceItem and validates against Phase 2 contract.
- Failures: Initial CLI indentation error was caught by tests and fixed before governance validation.
- Decisions: Keep Phase 3 tests offline and cap Phase 3 query construction at 50 results per call.
- Remaining risks: Live arXiv API availability, rate limits, and daily freshness are not yet covered by scheduler/runner gates.
- Rollback: Revert Phase 3 adapter code, tests, fixture, and governance updates.
- Next step: Start Phase 4 queue/ranking once final Phase 3 validation passes.

- Result commit: PENDING
- Task IDs: ADP-PHASE4-RANKING-001
- Goal: Implement deterministic 100-point candidate ranking with auditable component scores and fail-closed eligibility gates.
- Assumptions: Phase 4 ranks explicit candidate inputs only and does not fetch live sources, extract claims, generate lessons, send email, or create media.
- Files changed: ranking code, CLI command, ranking fixture, ranking tests, version files, and governance records.
- Model changes: Activated MOD-ADP-002 as adp-ranking-v1.
- Parameter changes: Activated PARAM-ADP-009 through PARAM-ADP-016 as adp-ranking-parameters-v1.
- Commands run: `PYTHONPATH=arxiv-daily-push/src python3 -m unittest discover -s arxiv-daily-push/tests -q`.
- Test results: 26 unit tests OK.
- Successes: Golden candidate scores 85.5 points; missing P0 evidence, metadata conflicts, and recent duplicate selections fail closed.
- Failures: none recorded at implementation time.
- Decisions: Use normalized 0..1 component signals multiplied by fixed weights summing to 100.
- Remaining risks: Live source freshness and automatic Claim Ledger extraction remain future gates.
- Rollback: Revert Phase 4 ranking code, tests, fixture, and governance updates.
- Next step: Start Phase 5 Claim Ledger extraction and publication gate after final Phase 4 validation passes.

### `ITER-20260621-005`

- Result commit: PENDING
- Task IDs: ADP-PHASE5-EVIDENCE-GATE-001
- Goal: Implement deterministic Claim Ledger construction and publication hard-block gates.
- Assumptions: Phase 5 consumes explicit evidence claims and does not parse PDFs, generate lesson text, send email, or create media.
- Files changed: evidence gate code, CLI command, Claim Ledger fixture, evidence gate tests, version files, and governance records.
- Model changes: Activated MOD-ADP-003 as adp-claim-gate-v1.
- Parameter changes: Activated PARAM-ADP-017 and PARAM-ADP-018 as adp-evidence-parameters-v1.
- Commands run: `PYTHONPATH=arxiv-daily-push/src python3 -m unittest discover -s arxiv-daily-push/tests -q`.
- Test results: 32 unit tests OK.
- Successes: Missing P0 locator, unsupported P0, metadata conflict, and unsupported arXiv peer-review claims block publication.
- Failures: Initial empty `Publication.artifacts` output failed validation and was fixed by recording the Claim Ledger artifact.
- Decisions: Treat Claim Ledger as a required publication artifact before publication is ready.
- Remaining risks: Lesson generation and text-level claim coverage remain future gates.
- Rollback: Revert Phase 5 evidence gate code, tests, fixture, and governance updates.
- Next step: Start Phase 6 evidence-linked lesson generation.


### `ITER-20260621-006`

- Date: 2026-06-21

- Result commit: PENDING
- Task IDs: ADP-PHASE6-LESSON-001
- Goal: Implement deterministic Chinese Lesson JSON generation from supported Claim Ledger evidence.
- Assumptions: Phase 6 remains text-only and does not synthesize narration, download models, render video, run schedulers, or send SMTP mail.
- Files changed: lesson generation code, CLI command, lesson fixture, lesson tests, version files, and governance records.
- Model changes: Activated MOD-ADP-006 as adp-lesson-v1.
- Parameter changes: Activated PARAM-ADP-035 and PARAM-ADP-036 as adp-lesson-parameters-v1.
- Commands run: `PYTHONPATH=arxiv-daily-push/src python3 -m unittest discover -s arxiv-daily-push/tests -q`.
- Test results: 37 unit tests OK.
- Successes: Generated Lesson JSON references only supported claim IDs; unverified non-P0 claims are excluded; blocked ledgers prevent generation; unregistered section claims fail validation.
- Failures: none recorded at implementation time.
- Decisions: Use deterministic template generation with visible `[claim_id]` markers rather than model-generated free text.
- Remaining risks: Narration/TTS, media rendering, daily scheduler, Release upload, and real SMTP transport remain future gates.
- Rollback: Revert Phase 6 lesson code, tests, fixture, and governance updates.
- Next step: Start Phase 7 narration/TTS dry-run and resource gate.


### `ITER-20260621-007`

- Date: 2026-06-21
- Fact level: EXTRACTED for narration dry-run code, CLI command, schema, local fixture, tests, and governance updates.

- Result commit: PENDING
- Task IDs: ADP-PHASE7-TTS-001
- Goal: Implement narration/TTS-ready dry-run JSON and resource gates without audio synthesis or retained media.
- Assumptions: Phase 7 remains dry-run only and does not download models, synthesize voice, write audio files, render video, run schedulers, or send SMTP mail.
- Files changed: narration dry-run code, CLI command, narration schema, narration fixture, tests, version files, and governance records.
- Model changes: Activated MOD-ADP-007 as adp-narration-v1.
- Parameter changes: Activated PARAM-ADP-037 through PARAM-ADP-040 as adp-narration-parameters-v1.
- Commands run: `PYTHONPATH=arxiv-daily-push/src python3 -m unittest discover -s arxiv-daily-push/tests -q`.
- Test results: 42 unit tests OK.
- Successes: Dry-run narration plan maps Lesson sections to segments, real TTS mode is blocked, audio paths are rejected, and runtime parameters expose real synthesis disabled.
- Failures: none recorded at implementation time.
- Decisions: Keep Phase 7 artifact as JSON only and defer any media writes until later resource gates pass.
- Remaining risks: Video rendering, daily scheduler, Release upload, and real SMTP transport remain future gates.
- Rollback: Revert Phase 7 narration code, schema, tests, fixture, and governance updates.
- Next step: Start Phase 8 video/storyboard dry-run and media QA gate.
