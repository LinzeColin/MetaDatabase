# MVP Development Record

Append-only development ledger for 商域图谱 / Enterprise Ecosystem Intelligence.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 1 / G1 start

Status: IN PROGRESS

Completed:

- Imported the v4.2.0 Task Pack into an implementation repository.
- Created a baseline Git commit before implementation changes.
- Confirmed Task Pack validation passes after import.

Current scope:

- G1 repository foundation and governance synchronization.

Current Acceptance IDs:

- A004, A005, A006, A007, A008, A009, A010, A131, A132, A133, A134, A135, A153, A169, A177.

Evidence commands:

- `PYTHONPATH=/Users/linzezhang/.cache/codex-runtimes/codex-primary-runtime/dependencies/python/lib/python3.12/site-packages python scripts/validate_task_pack.py`

Residual risks:

- `pnpm`, `uv`, and `docker` are not globally installed on the current host.
- Raw `python3 scripts/validate_task_pack.py` fails until Python dependencies are pinned through project tooling.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 1 / G1 repository foundation batch 1

Status: IN PROGRESS

Completed:

- Added pinned root workspace files: `Makefile`, `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Added FastAPI health shell under `apps/api`.
- Added Watchlist-first Next.js app shell under `apps/web`.
- Added worker/package/infra/test directory anchors.
- Added contract validation and secret scan scripts.
- Added Playwright homepage smoke test.

Verification results:

- `make bootstrap`: PASS.
- `make health`: PASS.
- `make verify`: PASS.
- `npx --yes pnpm@11.8.0 --filter @eei/web build`: PASS.
- `npx --yes pnpm@11.8.0 --filter @eei/web test:e2e`: PASS after installing Playwright Chromium.

Residual risks:

- Docker is not installed on the current host, so `docker compose up -d postgres` and PostgreSQL container health checks were not executed.
- G1 remains IN PROGRESS until the Docker/PostgreSQL health path is verified or an approved non-Docker fallback is added.
- Unit tests pass with a FastAPI/Starlette deprecation warning about `httpx`; monitor when upgrading test dependencies.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 1 / G1 database readiness contract

Status: IN PROGRESS

Completed:

- Added a PostgreSQL readiness check using pinned `psycopg[binary]==3.3.4`.
- Changed `/health/ready` and `make health` so they fail closed when `DATABASE_URL` is missing or PostgreSQL is unreachable.
- Added unit coverage for missing database configuration and successful `select 1` readiness.
- Added `make db-up`, `make db-down`, `make db-logs`, and `make verify-g1`.

Verification results:

- `make bootstrap-python`: PASS.
- `make test-unit`: PASS, 3 tests.
- `make lint`: PASS.
- `make verify`: PASS.
- `npx --yes pnpm@11.8.0 --filter @eei/web build`: PASS.
- `npx --yes pnpm@11.8.0 --filter @eei/web test:e2e`: PASS.
- `make health`: expected FAIL on current host with `status=not_ready` and `database=not_configured`.
- `make verify-g1`: expected FAIL on current host because `docker` is not installed.

Residual risks:

- G1 cannot pass until Docker/PostgreSQL readiness is verified on a host with Docker or an approved PostgreSQL service path.
- The current host has no `docker` and no `psql` executable.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 1 / G1 environment doctor and GitHub validation entry

Status: IN PROGRESS

Completed:

- Added `scripts/env_doctor.py` and `make doctor` for structured local environment diagnostics.
- Confirmed the current host reports `docker=null`, `psql=null`, `postgres=null`, `initdb=null`, `database.status=not_configured`, and `g1_ready=false`.
- Added a root GitHub Actions workflow in `LinzeColin/CodexProject` at `.github/workflows/eei-validation.yml` because nested `EEI/.github/workflows/*` files do not run when EEI is stored as a subdirectory.

Verification results:

- `make doctor`: PASS as diagnostic output; reports G1 not ready.
- `.github/workflows/eei-validation.yml` YAML parse: PASS.
- `make lint`: PASS.
- `make verify`: PASS.
- `make verify-g1`: expected FAIL on current host because `docker` is not installed.

Residual risks:

- The root GitHub workflow has been added for future remote verification, but remote Actions status still needs to be inspected after push.
- G1 remains blocked on an actual Docker/PostgreSQL-capable runtime.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 1 / G1 PostgreSQL startup wait contract

Status: IN PROGRESS

Completed:

- Confirmed the first root GitHub Actions run reached the G1 PostgreSQL/E2E step and failed there after static, contract, lint, typecheck, and unit tests passed.
- Added `scripts/wait_for_database.py` to poll the same `select 1` database readiness contract used by `/health/ready`.
- Added `make wait-db` and changed `make db-up` so Docker startup waits for PostgreSQL before `make health`.
- Added the wait script to `make lint`.

Verification results:

- `make lint`: PASS.
- `make verify`: PASS.
- `env -u DATABASE_URL .venv/bin/uv run python scripts/wait_for_database.py --timeout 1`: expected FAIL with `ERROR: DATABASE_URL is required before waiting for PostgreSQL`.
- `make verify-g1`: expected FAIL on current host because `docker` is not installed.

Residual risks:

- The current host still has no Docker runtime, so local `make verify-g1` remains an expected fail-closed check until Docker/PostgreSQL is available.
- Remote GitHub Actions must be re-run after this change to determine whether the failure was solely a PostgreSQL startup race.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 1 / G1 close and G2 start

Status: G1 PASS; G2 IN PROGRESS

Completed:

- Pushed `LinzeColin/CodexProject` commit `5de38fd` with the PostgreSQL wait contract.
- Confirmed GitHub Actions run `27820777762` completed with conclusion `success`.
- Confirmed the `verify` job and all steps passed, including `Verify G1 PostgreSQL readiness and E2E`.
- Advanced `data/release_gate_catalog.csv` to `G1=PASS` and `G2=IN PROGRESS`.

Verification results:

- GitHub Actions run: `https://github.com/LinzeColin/CodexProject/actions/runs/27820777762`.
- GitHub Actions job: `https://github.com/LinzeColin/CodexProject/actions/runs/27820777762/job/82333085277`.
- Step 8 `Verify G1 PostgreSQL readiness and E2E`: PASS.

G2 scope and Acceptance IDs:

- T200: A011, A012, A013, A014, A015, A022.
- T201: A016, A020, A021.
- T202: A019.
- T203: A011, A090.
- T204: A017, A018, A028.
- T205: A016, A025, A067.
- T206: A023.
- T207: A024, A028.
- T208: A011, A026, A027.
- T1103: A136, A137.
- T1104: A138, A139, A140.
- T1105: A141, A142.
- T1106: A143, A144, A145.
- T1107: A146, A147.
- T1108: A148, A149, A150.
- T1109: A151, A152.
- T1203: A169, A170.

Residual risks:

- Local host still cannot run Docker-based `make verify-g1`; G1 PASS is based on GitHub Actions evidence.
- G2 has a wide acceptance surface; implementation should split database migrations/data checks from visual canvas work to keep diffs reviewable.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 1 / G2 database foundation batch 1

Status: IN PROGRESS

Completed:

- Added `infra/db/migrations/0001_core_domain/up.sql` and `down.sql`.
- Added `scripts/migrate.py` for versioned PostgreSQL upgrade/downgrade/status operations.
- Added `scripts/load_seed_catalogs.py` for deterministic catalog and research-universe seed loading.
- Added `scripts/check_database_schema.py` for table and seed-count invariants.
- Added `tests/integration/test_database_migrations.py` for migration, seed idempotency, and rollback.
- Added `make verify-g2-db` to run Docker PostgreSQL, health, static verification, integration tests, and E2E.
- Extended `specs/domain_schema.sql` with catalog-backed relationship families, relationship types, supply-chain stages, seed runs, and research-universe tables.
- Marked T200, T201, T202, T203, T204, T206, T207, and T208 as `IN PROGRESS`.

Verification results:

- `make lint`: PASS.
- `make verify`: PASS.
- `env -u DATABASE_URL .venv/bin/uv run pytest tests/integration -q`: PASS with 1 expected skip.
- `make verify-g2-db`: expected FAIL on current host because `docker` is not installed.

Acceptance IDs touched:

- A011, A012, A013, A014, A015, A016, A017, A018, A019, A020, A021, A022, A023, A024, A026, A027, A028, A090.

Residual risks:

- Actual PostgreSQL migration execution has not been proven locally because Docker is unavailable.
- GitHub Actions must be updated to run `make verify-g2-db` and prove migration/seed/rollback on PostgreSQL.
- T205 synthetic recursive supply-chain fixtures and T1103-T1109 visual canvas tasks are not started.
